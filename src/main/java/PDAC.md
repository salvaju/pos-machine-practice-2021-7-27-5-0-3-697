1. Function Name: ItemDataLoader <br>
P: 5mins <br>
D: 8mins and 12secs  <br>
C: Even though I did not code this class I tried to analyze it and check on how to implement it on the project <br>
A: More familiarization on Java Code to quickly familiarize other developer codes <br>

<br>

2. Function Name: convertBarcodeToItems <br>
P: 1hour <br>
D: 47mins and 29secs <br>
C: it was hard for me to implement the proper logic on converting the Barcode into Items since I tried to add the subtotal with it <br>
A: Try to understand the logic specifically and practice on logic for developing. <br>

<br>

3. Function Name: evaluateTotalPrice <br>
P: 5mins <br>
D: 3mins and 2secs <br>
C: Was particularly easy to evaluate the total price <br>
A: Will try to add the simplicity on other functions <br>

<br>
